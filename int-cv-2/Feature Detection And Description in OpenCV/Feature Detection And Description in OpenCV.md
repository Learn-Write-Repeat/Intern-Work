*  ***What is Feature Detection and Description?***

   * We humans distinguish one thing or object from another flawlessly in our daily lives because we don't pay attention to how this happens; it's all pre-programmed in our brain.     
   * If we see an image or item, we look at it intently and try to uncover a pattern that will help us distinguish it from others, and this all happens in the background.
   
   * When we look at the above image, our brain begins to notice a pattern, such as the black box representing the sky, the white box representing the building's windows, and the red box representing the building's walls.
   
   * All of these characteristics may be discovered simply by looking at the photograph.We can look for this feature in other photos or objects once we've found it in this one.
   
   * This method is called <b>Feature Detection</b>, and after we locate a feature, we describe it in our own words, such as a black box representing the sky, a white box representing a window, and so on.
