<h3><li>What is Feature Detection and Description?</li></h3>
<p>We humans distinguish one thing or object from another         flawlessly in our daily lives because we don't pay attention to how this happens; it's all pre-programmed in our brain. If we see an image or item, we look at it intently and try to uncover a pattern that will help us distinguish it from others, and this all happens in the background.</p>
